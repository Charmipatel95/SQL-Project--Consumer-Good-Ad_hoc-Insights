# CONSUMER GOODS AD-HOC INSIGHTS
## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.
However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both the skills.

:link: [LinkedIn Post](   )

Here's a rundown of everything I've learned:
## :mag: Key Skills:
- Using SQL for basic and advance queries
- PowerBi Desktop for creating visualisation and presenting meaningful insights from them
- DAX language for advanced calculations
- Using Canva and Microsoft PowerPoint for presenting the visualisation

## :bulb: SQL Concepts:
- Clauses : SELECT , WHERE, GROUPBY, ORDERBY, LIMIT
- Aggregate functions: SUM(), MIN(), MAX(),AVG()
- Windows functions: RANK(), PARTITION BY
- Common table Expressions (CTE) and Sub queries
- Joins for combining data from multiple tables

## :memo:PROBLEM STATEMENT
To generate and present meaningful insights to top management, the Data Analytics team has been given the following task.

1.    Check ‚Äòad-hoc-requests.pdf‚Äô - there are 10 ad hoc requests for which the business needs insights.
2.    You need to run a SQL query to answer these requests. 
3.    The target audience of this dashboard is top-level management - hence you need to create a presentation to show the insights.
4.    Be creative with your presentation, audio/video presentation will have more weightage.
